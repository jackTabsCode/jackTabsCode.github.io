Hi, I'm Jack, a software engineer, and I've been creating games on the [Roblox](https://roblox.com) platform for 6 years. My passion lies in designing games that prioritize the playerâ€™s experience and push the limits of the platform.

I am proficient in a variety of programming languages related to Roblox development, including [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [Luau](https://luau-lang.org), as well as industry standard tooling. I also maintain a couple of popular open source projects made in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), my new favorite language!

Please see my [About](/about) page for a more detailed overview of my experience and skills.
